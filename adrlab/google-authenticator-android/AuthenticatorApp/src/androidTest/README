Some tests require Mockito and DexMaker to compile and run.
The two libraries need to be included into the APK.

* Mockito: http://code.google.com/p/mockito/
* DexMaker: http://code.google.com/p/dexmaker/

When importing this project into Eclipse, add mockito.jar
("all" JAR rather than the "core" JAR) and dexmaker.jar
to the "libs" directory of this test project.
